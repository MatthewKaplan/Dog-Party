# Dog Party

The purpose of this project was to recreate the dog party website provided by our teachers. 

##  Description

The web page was written with HTML and CSS using only floats. I set media queries so that when the browser is shrunk to different sizes, the elements on the page adjust accordingly.

## Challenges

Only using floats for this project was a huge challenge in itself, it would've been a lot easier using either grids or flexbox but I did learn a lot about the box model while messing around with paddings and margins to replicate the page as best as possible. My biggest struggle was to get the buttons bellow the articles to vertically align.
